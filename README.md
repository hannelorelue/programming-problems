# 100 Java Programming Problems

In this repository I implement 100 Java programming problems from the following set of challenges [100 Must attempt Problems for Coding Interview](https://iq.opengenus.org/100-interview-problems/)

## Array Problems

### Move Negative elements to the front

#### Problem statement:
move the negative elements of an array to the front

#### Example:

Input will be:
```
2 -9 10 12 5 -2 10 -4
```

Output will be:
```
-9 -2 -4 2 10 12 5 10
```

Note:

* The order of negative elements are same.
* The order of positive elements are same.
* All negative elements have been moved to the front.
* All positive elements have been moved to the end or followed by all the negative elements.

Implemented in [Test.java](./Test.java) additional nodes on how it is implemented e.g. O(n log n) instead of naive O(n)
